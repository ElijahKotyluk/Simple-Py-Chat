# Simple-Py-Chat
Simple Server/Client.py file for chatting with friends.

# Getting started
- Clone this repo
- Locate the directory of this app
- run "python3 {file-name}" to run the server/client. (Only works locally at the moment)

# Future plans
- Create remote server so that the user can connect and chat remotely.
- Add a database to save conversations and past messages.
- Add a user sign up.
- Add a "friend list" so you can keep in contact with friends and family.
